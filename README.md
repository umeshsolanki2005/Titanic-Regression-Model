Participated in the Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge to dive into ML competitions
and doing first project in Kaggle platform.The competition is simple: using machine learning I 
created a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. 
I used Decision tree classifier as predictive algorithm for classification.
